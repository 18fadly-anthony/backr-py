## Features

- Store different backups in different locations

- Backup a folder and one or more of its subfolders separately

- Delete old backups to save space without affecting more recent ones

## ToDo

1. ~~rename hash and dir variables~~

2. prefer args to prompting the user

3. use separate variables for backr_location

4. restor â€”clean feature to remove old backups from backup list

5. use Makefile to compile files in installation

6. do less in main() (keep in mind during other todos)
